    "text": "Dear Mrinalini Aunty,\nI introduced the idea in parts to my grandmother, Ba, a few weeks ago and I knew which recipe I wanted to ask of her — it had to be jalebis. Ba’s jalebis are famous in the family — they are soft but crispy, sweet but just the right amount, and fried in ghee. I was introduced to her jalebis as an adult, really, so my memories of it are fairly new — but a bite into her jalebi will transport you to another world, one where it didn’t matter where these jalebis had been all your life, but you were happy to be enjoying them in that moment. Asking the women in my family to write is like asking them to move a mountain — and I think they would rather move a mountain. So, I began by asking Ba to send me a picture of a recipe for jalebis, handwritten by her. \nTo my surprise, I saw a ping on my WhatsApp just a few days later — it was from Ba and she had attached a picture of the recipe. Ba had written down the recipe on a notepad, had waited for my aunt to come home, and asked her to take a picture. My aunt then proceeded to forward the photo from Ba’s WhatsApp to me in Bangalore. I was excited to receive this, but unfortunately couldn’t understand the recipe because it was written in Gujarati. So I called up my aunt, who read it out loud in Gujarati, while I typed the words in English on a Google doc. It was a comical process, but it wasn’t over yet. Reading a letter is like reading the writer’s inside voice, and I was curious to hear what my grandmother had to say. A week later, I received a photo from my aunt again—this time it was a short note, not really a letter, once again in Gujarati script, titled “jalebi.” Ba had addressed it to no one, but I was still grateful for a peek into my grandmother’s inner voice, even if it was just about jalebi.",

    "text": "Jalebi by Sushma Hundiwala\n\n“Jalebi is one dish that will surely make your mouth water just by thinking about it. I have eaten many Jalebis as a child, but I am curious about how Jalebis are made today. Since my childhood, I have always been eager to learn new recipes - either by asking someone or by following recipes found in books and the newspaper. If we make Jalebi today, it is sure to bring people together. When people enjoy and take pleasure in eating freshly prepared Jalebis, the cook is also happy. So, come let's make Jalebi and let’s eat them together!”\n\nIngredients for Jalebi\n250g maida or all-purpose flour\n50g rava or semolina\n2 tbsp. oil\n1 tsp curd\n2 tbsp besan/gram flour or rice flour\n500g sugar\n1 tsp. elaichi powder and kesar (cardamom and saffron strands) for flavoring\nGhee for frying\n\nMethod\nMix the rava, maida, curd, oil and approximately one bowl of lukewarm water into a thick batter. The batter should be of cake batter consistency. If the temperature in your kitchen is on the cooler side, let the batter ferment upto 3 days. If your kitchen is warm, let the batter ferment for 12-15 hours. Make sure you cover the batter and store it in a closed, dry place. This makes sure the batter ferments well.",

    "text": "Dear Mrinalini Aunty,\n\nAn afternoon comes to mind and I’d like to share it with you. I must have been a teenager, and my aunt shared a story. We must have been talking about cooking, home, the good old days, or some such thing. I thought she was telling us about our aunt, her sister-in-law, whom she refers to as “Bhabhi.” When Bhabhi arrived in Akot, her new residence as a newlywed, she was already very “well-educated.” She was a lawyer? Or a doctor? My aunt tries to recall with a hint of awe in her voice. \n\nBut the thing is, Bhabhi failed to make round rotis. Her father-in-law noticed this and was amused, so he went around and told everyone about the new bahu, his daughter-in-law, and her misshapen rotis — to the point that Bhabhi was driven to tears one day. But the father-in-law wasn’t a vindictive man, even though he had shamed her, he taught his daughter-in-law how to make perfectly round rotis. I later recognised that the protagonist of the story was not Bhabhi but the father-in-law, my aunt’s uncle. I sometimes wonder how Bhabhi would remember this story. She wasn’t around to tell us.",

    "text": "<strong>Sabudana Khichdi by Malvika</strong>\n\nFor a pot of Sabudana Khichdi which will feed 2-3 hungry people\n\nIngredients for Sabudana Khichdi:\n3 cups sabudana \n2 cups raw peanuts - 2 cups\n2 tbsp. ghee\n5-6 tbsp sugar \n1 -1½  tsp. salt \n1½  tbsp. cumin\n2-3 hot green chillies roughly chopped\nLemon juice and coriander to garnish\n\nDirections:\nSabudana, prep time 8-12 hours.\nWash the starch from the sabudana pearls 4-5 times. \nNext, soak the sabudana in water to just about cover it. This is the trickiest part as you don't want sticky sabudana. So fill your bowl with the pearls and then fill water only 3 mm above it. It will expand so allow room for that. Give it 8-12 hours or overnight.\n\nPeanuts, prep time 15 min.\nTake a heavy bottomed pan or wok and dry-roast your peanuts till the coats start browning. Once roasted, let them cool (so important) and then take off the papery coats by either rubbing the peanuts between your palms or in a kitchen towel. Transfer everything into a flat thali or plate. You don't have to get it all off, some of it is good fibre!\n\nTraditionally, at this point, the husky coat is removed using a winnow or a Soop, which is part of some weddings, including my own! But you can remove them by inclining the thali and blowing the husk away. You can do this in your garden or over a sink. \n\nNext, you can grind the peanuts coarsely in a mortar and pestle or in a blender. Just be sure to blitz it for only 2-3 seconds at a time, so as to not cross over into the peanut butter territory. Keep it on the grainy side and some chunky peanuts are tasty too!\n\nKhichdi, prep time 10 min.\nIn a large bowl, mix your peanut powder, salt and sugar till it is a large sandy mix. Now mix it into the soaked, soft sabudana pearls making sure there is no excess water. Feel free to add more sugar and salt later, as desired.\n\nThis is a dal-less khichdi but it still needs ghee. Ghee and khichdi are inseparable companions but sesame or groundnut oil are also yummy, nutty alternatives.\n\nIn a kadhai, on a medium flame, heat ghee. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter. Add chopped green chillies and let them blister. At this point, your kitchen will be filled with the smell of ghee and woody notes of jeera. A tadka is always quite divine. \n\nOnce the chillies are done, some people add very finely chopped potatoes but I find their starch and cooking time a little intrusive to the process so I avoid them. Next, add the sabudana-peanut mix into the kadhai and use a wooden spatula to toss it around in the tadka. Once it starts to cook, the sabudana will get translucent and stickier, harder to toss. So in the first couple of minutes, be sure to mix it well. In about 5-6 minutes, your sugar would've melted, the peanuts would be cooked and coated in ghee and before the sabudana starts to stick, take it off the stove. \n\nSqueeze half a lemon and sprinkle chopped coriander over the khichdi and give it a last toss. And that's it - a chewy, crunchy, yummy, hot, sabudana khichdi. \n\nIt is one of my comfort foods and while this is my favourite, I enjoy almost every variation of it. I wish I had better pictures too, these are a khichdi of Whatsapp pictures from different times. But the next time I make it, I will spare a moment to plate it well and take a picture that motivates people to try this recipe.",

This usually takes about 5 minutes. (I keep some un-toasted seeds on the side so I can compare!) Once the seeds have cooled, grind it into a fine paste. Add 4-5 tbsp. sunflower oil and salt to taste (I usually add about 1 tsp. salt, because I really like my food salty!). Grind again. \nYou should now have a slightly bitter sauce. Ta-da! Your tahini is ready!\n\nDirections for Hummus: \nAdd the cooked chickpeas, tahini, lemon juice, crushed garlic cloves, water, cumin powder, and salt & pepper to a grinder. Grind until it becomes a creamy paste. \nAdd the olive oil and grind again. \n\nGarnish the hummus with a drizzle of olive oil, some paprika or chilli powder, and chopped olives. \n\nTips:\n1.  Now if you are lazy like me, use a big enough all-purpose mixer-grinder for the tahini. In this way, you don’t have to take the mixture out and can directly make the hummus in it! \n2.  If your hummus is too coarse, add more water. \n3.  If it’s bitter, neutralize it with lemon juice and salt. If it’s still bitter, add more chickpeas and grind again. \n4.  Turn it into Beetroot Hummus: Peel, chop, and boil 1 beetroot until you can easily poke the pieces with a fork. After the hummus is made, add the beetroot and grind one last time. \n5.  I store the hummus in my fridge for 5-7 days. \n\nSome food to eat hummus with:\n- Toasted bread \n- Kuboos \n- Pan-fried broccoli \n- Biscuits \n- Lavaash ",

If our way of thinking sparks something in the minds of our students that is good. If our way of thinking sets minds free, that will be great. If we take the word “inoculation” in the literal sense, it might unnecessarily fetter our minds and inhibit our creativity. Instead, one could think of it in a metaphoric manner to suggest the introduction of a new idea—the idea of sharing recipes with other women; to people who fed us, who cared for us.",

    "text": "Dear Eeshita,\n\nI told you about my desire to talk to Sugunamma and ask her for a recipe for this project. Sugunamma came to us at a very crucial time in our family life and took over much of the responsibility of cleaning our house and, later on, even cooking for us. Most career women in India would not be able to pursue their profession without domestic help. Lakshmi Akka in my childhood, Shiromani Akka in Kiran Uncle’s household, and Sugunamma when we returned to Bangalore in 1997: without their kindness and willingness to support other households, we would not be what we are today. What we received from them - even in terms of their kindness towards us - was much more than what we were willing to give them. \n\nI wanted to ask Sugunamma specifically for her recipe for gala gala. It was something that she made for us every Christmas. Even though it had the same shape as the sweet kal kal that my father made for Christmas, it was prepared differently by Sugunamma. It tasted different as well. I communicate with Sugunamma through her daughter Ammu who contacts me through WhatsApp. When I asked her if she could phone her mother and get from her the recipe for gala gala, Ammu reminded me that she could not go to her mother due to COVID-19 restrictions. However, she told me that she would be able to send the recipe herself. Ammu does not have an email account for herself. Hence, she typed the gala gala recipe on her computer, took a photograph of her screen, and sent it to me through WhatsApp. Even though my primary goal was to contact Sugunamma, her daughter had become the conduit for the sharing of a recipe. I am unable to include the recipe that she sent me through WhatsApp in this email. I have forwarded the recipe to you through WhatsApp so that you can insert it into the project.",

Grind the jackfruit into a smooth paste in a mixer-blender, without adding water. Gather all the other ingredients listed under the “To Grind” section and grind them with the jackfruit to a fine paste in a mixer blender, without adding water. The batter should be thicker than dosa batter (thicker than cake batter) but you should be able to spread it easily on the teak leaf. If the batter seems watery, you can add a bit of rice powder. \n\nClean and wipe dry the teak leaves with a clean cloth. Next, spread 1 or 2 ladle full of batter evenly on the center of the teak leaf. Leave some room in the leaf to fold it from all 4 sides so that a square pocket is formed, and batter is covered from all sides. \n\nNext, boil a little water in an idli steamer or any steaming apparatus and place all the square leaf pockets inside. Steam for about 30 mins. Remove the leaves before serving. If you use Teak leaves, you will notice a nice reddish hue on the cake. If you use banana leaves, this hue will not be present. You can either serve gatti as it is or with ghee.",

During the conversation, she had emphatically stated: “Kitchen is the battleground of women.” It is often true, especially if there is an intergenerational power struggle, to lay claim over the space of the kitchen. I didn’t really have a chance to share the kitchen space with my mother-in-law, or now with my daughter-in- law. The precursor to this project is the email exchanges that we had because we did not have this chance to work together in the kitchen. We turned it into this project that examines the gendered and generationalist claims of the kitchen space — both metaphorically and literally — and turned it into something that brings out memories and tackles questions related to internalized forms of patriarchy. Many men in my family — especially those from the younger generation, are really good at cooking. I am grateful that what could have easily turned into an ideologically loaded project has become a project that examines even as it creatively questions our assumptions about cooking and normative roles.
