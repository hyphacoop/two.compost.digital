# A Confluence of Waters

## Exploring Connections with The Blue Marbles Project

_Andi Wong and Margaret Warren_

In the Summer of 2019, we - Andi Wong and Margaret Warren met for the first time at one of the Friday lunches at the Internet Archive on Funston Street in San Francisco. The context of their meeting was in planning art activities for the upcoming Decentralized Web Camp to be held at The Mushroom Farm.

It was there that Andi first shared a blue marble with Margaret. But that is not where this story begins and it’s certainly not the end.

This story is non-linear and organically expanding. Like mushrooms in a Fairy Circle. Like when the web used to have something called web rings.  Like Bucky Balls: nano particles of carbon atoms in a spherical structure. Like the new vision of the web: decentralized and linked through nodes and edges. A synchronistic murmuration of inspirations and enchantment.

The ancient Greeks first declared the sphere the most perfect form and proclaimed it was the shape of the earth and all the planets. Then on December 7, 1972, the crew of the Apollo 17 spacecraft made this vision evident when it made this image of the earth, nicknamed “The Blue Marble,” on December 7, 1972.

### Apollo 17: Blue Marble (Dec 7, 1972)

>One of the most widely known photographs of Earth, this image was taken by the crew of the final Apollo mission as the crew made its way to the Moon. Dubbed the “Blue Marble,” Earth is revealed as both a vast planet home to billions of creatures and a beautiful orb capable of fitting into the pocket of the universe.

### Blue Marbles Project: Synergy defined by Buckminster Fuller (2014)

>SYNERGY is the behavior of whole systems not predicted, suggested or inferred by any parts of the SYSTEM when those parts are considered ONLY SEPARATELY considered one by one separately by themselves. Six tubes have nothing that tells you they will make a tetrahedron. The milk cartons one by one do not tell you of their associated beauty as a complex sphere. They are not beautiful when a few come together, but as they become associated in an orderly manner they become more interesting, but only attain full beauty by completion of the sphere." - Buckminster Fuller, November 4, 1974
>
>Artist Aiko Cuneo brought the definition of "Synergy," written in Buckminster Fuller's own hand, to share at the Tinkering Studio. Aiko's mother artist Ruth Asawa, a student of Buckminster Fuller, was the first Artist in Residency at the Exploratorium in 1974, conducting workshops where she and groups of young people made complex geometric structures with empty milk cartons. Forty years later, Aiko was there to lead her own "Milk Cartons Reimagined" Workshop. https://www.exploratorium.edu/tinkering/blog/2014/09/11/tinkering-social-club-milk-cartons-re-imagined-with-aiko-cuneo

Now jump to 2009 when a marine biologist, Dr. Wallace J. Nichols, known simply as “J” had an ambitious idea to hand his friend LeBaron Myers a blue marble. That simple act became an idea which then became a movement. A low-tech-slow-motion global art project with a seemingly staggering goal of passing a blue marble through the hands of every (yes, every) person on OUR Blue Marble earth, and along with each passing - a simple message of gratitude and reminder that everything we do on our water planet matters.

### Dr. Nichols holding a blue marble

>Dr. Nichols is currently a senior fellow at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies’ Center for the Blue Economy, and a research associate at the California Academy of Sciences. He is a cofounder of Ocean Revolution, an international network of young ocean advocates and Grupo Tortuguero de las Californias, an international sea turtle conservation network. From his page: https://www.wallacejnichols.org/130/blue-marbles.html

Dr. Nichols is an innovative and entrepreneurial scientist.  In 1996, J placed a satellite-tag on an adult female loggerhead sea turtle that was released into the wild after being rescued in Baja, Mexico. Adelita, named after a local fisherman’s daughter, was the first animal tracked across the Pacific Ocean, traveling over 9,000 miles from Baja, Mexico to her place of birth in Sendai, Japan. Thanks to the Internet, Adelita’s journey was followed by children everywhere.

In 2010, Andi went to hear J talk about sea turtles, after an introductory email exchange about water. She wrote to ask J about his view of the changing waters of the Gulf of Mexico, after seeing his iCNN video report online. She was planning field trips to introduce schoolchildren to the Impressionists at the deYoung Museum in San Francisco. One of the artworks on display was Claude Monet’s “Impression, Sunrise,” the 1872 painting which gave the Impressionist movement its name. Monet’s loose brushstrokes of color depicted his hometown waters shimmering with the intense light of an orange sun.

J often asks people the question: ‘Where is your water?’ to kick off a conversation.
What is the special place where you find you go to the water’s edge? For some, it might be the neighborhood swimming pool. Others might answer that they go kayaking or sailing, or they think of a tropical island paradise where they go on vacation. Garden hoses, public fountains, opened fire hydrant, or ocean surf… Really, there is no wrong answer.

Scientists and teachers spend a lot of time crafting thoughtful open-ended questions when they want more than a simple “yes” or “no” answer.

When J asked Andi this question, she really had to think before answering. Andi writes:

> My water begins in a small town in the California Delta called Locke, a historic rural Chinese-American community in the United States. The town of Locke was built in 1915 by Chinese residents, after the Chinatown in nearby Walnut Grove was destroyed by fire. I enjoyed lazy childhood summers in Locke, staying with my grandparents in their home on Main Street, where my cousins and I had the run of the wooden plank walkways and the back alleys of this tiny four-block town. Locke was our Wild West, a place where we could roam and play until sundown, and we children grew up with very little knowledge of the extreme challenges faced by our families: The Page Act of 1875, The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, The Geary Act of 1892, The Alien Law of 1913 which prohibited the Chinese from owning land. There, in this isolated town, my mother’s family made it through The Great Depression and World War II. In the 40’s and 50’s, young people left Locke for the suburbs, searching for greater opportunity and better living conditions, and the town aged.

### The Blue Marbles Project: Locke Chinese School (2015)

>On the 100th Anniversary Celebration of Locke, California, The Blue Marble was among the visitors to the tiny one-room schoolhouse which served as a language school for the children of Locke. The Kuo Ming School in Locke was opened in 1926, with funding from the Nationalist Party of China. The children of Locke came here to learn Cantonese reading and writing skills after their regular school day attending school in Walnut Grove, where the elementary schools were segregated into Asian and Caucasian classes. In 1954, with support from the Joe Shoong Foundation, the Chinese School was renovated and renamed the Joe Shoong School. The school closed in the mid-eighties due to the decreased youth population and lack of enrollment.

The town was purchased by a Hong Kong developer in 1977, with big plans to create a Chinese “theme park,” complete with yacht marina and condominiums. The plan was abandoned after a special zoning ordinance was established by the Sacramento Board of Supervisors to preserve the historic town in 1979. But by 2001, the town of Locke was slated to be condemned, due to water and sewer problems. Connie King, the unofficial “Mayor of Locke” was determined to save the town. She lobbied the Board, saying “if you remember the Chinese helped build the railroad, the Chinese built the levee, the Chinese start agriculture in California, and the Chinese built the town of Locke. You cannot condemn the town of Locke.”  In 2004, the citizens of Locke, including Auntie Connie, were finally able to purchase the land beneath their homes. When she passed away, volunteers paid tribute by turning her garden plot into a Chinese vegetable demonstration garden to educate the public about traditional Chinese vegetables and the history of the Pearl River Delta. Today, in 2021, Locke is one of 300 failing systems in California that routinely supply roughly 1 million people with contaminated drinking water. Testing has found that the town’s water supply is tainted with high levels of arsenic.
