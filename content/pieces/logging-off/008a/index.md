**TOPIC: What can I grow in a north-facing garden?**

The topic was posted yesterday at 8:09 PM. It begins with an apology: *I know this isn't a gardening forum, but you guys seem like you'd know…*

The first reply, at 8:23 PM, is fairly brusque:

> **ecotope** North or south hemisphere? Also, please update your profile with your location and/or hardiness so people can give you better advice.

New members are always forgetting this. You didn’t, but only because you spent hours reading the forum before making an account and saw how many people were chastised for it.

You read the responses with interest, not because you have any interest in gardening, but because you've run out of more relevant and salacious reading material.

People start complaining about the property market in the greater Toronto area. A political debate begins to emerge. Someone makes an "eat the rich" joke and one of the more humorless moderator steps in:

> **taiga `Moderator`**  Hey everyone, just a reminder that this isn't the place for political discussions.

What counts as "political discussion" in this forum has always confused you—it seems arbitrarily defined and even more arbitrarily enforced. After **taiga** posts, the thread continues listlessly. There are almost no planting recommendations, but someone starts recommending expensive hori-hori trowels to buy.
