Dear Reader,

The epistolary tradition in writing precedes the writing of a novel. It is a tradition that calls for slowness, reflection and intimacy, a rare pleasure in an era of urgent responses and priority messages. Reading a letter, a handwritten one especially, can offer a glimpse into the writer's inner voice, a voice captured in a moment of care and consideration. Letters hold the potential to envelope us in a feeling of closeness.

Before we begin this letter, we would like to introduce ourselves. We are Eeshita Kapadiya and Mrinalini Sebastian, writing from Bangalore and Philadelphia, respectively. We are writing to you today, as an invitation to join us in a conversation about food, labour and care.

In January 2020, we, Eeshita and Mrinalini, found ourselves in a new relationship, as daughter-in-law and mother-in-law. We were at a new beginning; we had the opportunity to create new memories and narratives, especially in a reality that normalised the belief that 'women are women's worst enemies’. Soon after, the coronavirus lockdown was announced bringing uncertainties and challenges with it. Separated by the pandemic and distance, we found space to connect over our shared joy for cooking and learning about food. Two women connecting over cooking is hardly radical, but two women speaking across generations, identities, faith and geography, has the potential to be. Circumstance introduced a new practice between us, a channel for our ideas - a series of email exchanges.

We began exchanging letters and recipes via email. Perhaps, through these episolatory exchanges, we were also trying to reminisce and relate, to get to know each other and to allay our intergenerational fears and anxieties about our relationship, and sharing the kitchen. In these letters we exchanged recipes that were special to us, we shared stories of the women we knew, and stories of our upbringing and the experiences that had shaped us into the women we were today. We called this exchange ‘Of Cooking and Conversations’. Cooking, for most of us, is a form of memory-laden inheritance. Our letters to each other made it evident that we had inherited the memories of not only our grandmothers and mothers, but also women who did not belong to our families, without whose help we would not have had the privilege of education and professional careers. These letters became testaments to the women who had cared for us, fed us and showed up for us in ways, expected and unexpected.

Our letter exchanges helped us look at the kitchen in a playful manner, not just a space that glorified women as nurturers nor one condemned it as marked by patriarchal expectations. The conversations attempted to ‘engender’ the kitchen space in new ways: remembering the physical labor that goes into the making of a dish, transcribing our beautiful memories associated with the smell, the laughter, the communal joy of creating and eating a traditional or new dish, recognizing those without whose care we would not be who we are today. To us, these exchanges offered a space for mutual gratitude and solidarity, for strengthening our bond and for remembering and acknowledging the care we received and continued to receive.

We continue to write to each other and exchange recipes; for us, the cooking and conversation has only just begun.
We then wondered: what if the idea of the letter exchange was introduced to more women? How would the idea travel? What could it unravel? Who do we write to? What are our memories of food and care? And what do we learn from each other’s ‘kitchen secrets’?

In June 2021, 16 months after our first email exchange, we asked friends and family to write letters and exchange recipes with women they knew or wanted to know better. The pandemic made it difficult for many of us to visit the post office, so we embraced digital technology, looking to our friend-foe, the email. Since then, more than 20 women, in different parts of the world, began to populate email inboxes of their friends, family, roommates, mentors with their letters, recipes, memories and conversations.

We called this network of women and recipes the Killjoy Cooking Network. Through these letters and the Killjoy Cooking Network, we explored the joy of cooking without losing sight of the fact that the kitchen, especially in the Indian context, has often become the site of killing. The word ‘killjoy’ came to us from Sara Ahmed’s blog, ‘Feminist Killjoy’ - a feminist killjoy being someone who refuses to look the other way, or just is ‘in the way’. What does the killjoy in the kitchen not look over then? As Killjoy cooks we remember the sustenance we receive with fondness, and refuse to forget the labour, the grief and grievances of aching legs, of aching hearts, of sweaty bodies and shattered dreams. Sara Ahmed writes: ‘The history of feminist critiques of happiness could be translated into a manifesto: Don't look over it: don't get over it.’ Killjoy cooks tell stories of how far we have come and the many miles left to go.

We recently came across the words: ‘The tongue is an archive’. So what did it mean for us to write about our everyday lives, labour and experiences? The Killjoy cooks’ letter exchange is an invitation to think deeply about the web of relationships we are a part of, and the wisdom we receive and impart in the process of caring and being cared for. Which memories stay and which ones leave? There are echoes, notions, that reverberate among us - contributing to a shared consciousness, a community. These stories have often travelled orally - hidden in cautionary tales, family secrets or kitchen banter. What better way to help us jog our memory then, than the sensory-laden act of cooking and eating.

Dear reader, this is our invitation to you.
To tell our stories is a feminist act, perhaps even revolutionary.
Can a recipe, the language of food, become our language of resistance, resilience and solidarity?

Who fed you? Who continues to feed you? And who would you like to share your story with?
If these questions inspire you, then write a letter to someone you know, a caregiver in your network who represents to you a beacon of support, wisdom and solidarity. Tell them your story of how you’ve been fed, nourished and nurtured, and exchange a recipe in solidarity. Join us in exchanging letters with the Killjoy Cooking Network and contribute to a shared repository of recipes and herstories.

Yours,
Eeshita Kapadiya
Mrinalini Sebastian
