When you check your phone you have three notifications: your Amazon delivery is arriving today, Uber Eats is giving you $20 off for the weekend, and your best friend is in distress. I'm doing this quiz and it's making me rethink my life tbh. A minute later, she sends another text: It's asking me if I know any edible plants or native grasses in our area! I'm not sure if I even know the difference between oregano and thyme at the grocery store.
She was reading a novel, she explains, and it referenced a quiz to see how grounded you are in the natural world, how rooted you are in place. She sends you a few:
What was the total rainfall in your area last year (July–June) in inches? (Ten? Twenty? You look outside the window and try to imagine twenty inches of water swelling into the soil)
How long is the growing season where you live? (You've never grown anything in your life)
What were the primary subsistence techniques of the culture that lived in your area before you? (You don't know; you feel embarrassed. Decolonization is not a metaphor: the phrases slips in and out of your consciousness, you probably saw it on Instagram or something, but it would be good to decolonize your knowledge of the world, at the very least)
What spring wildflower is consistently among the first to bloom where you live? (You've never known the names of them, and in any case it's rare you see a wildflower—on your morning commute you mostly see drought-resistant garden plants and cheery flowerboxes in the windows)

You and your friend are both rethinking your lives now.

When you walk outside, you feel newly aware of how unfamilar the world around you is. You pass under the dappled shade of the tree—is this native or non-native to the area? How are you supposed to know?
You pass a well-tended park where a few children, exuberant and shrill, are playing a game in the grass. Pollen tickles your nose and you sneeze. Your phone buzzes and you sneeze again. The pollen, too, is of mysterious provenance.
When you return home, you search for How do you get more in touch with nature? And then you look at your phone while the results load (not that it really takes that long). You open Twitter. Twenty minutes later you close Twitter. Then there's another notification. You open your email and read about a work issue you'll need to be very committed about resolving tomorrow. Twenty minutes later you close your email. Now it's bedtime. You look away from your phone and back to your laptop.
Now you're scrolling absently through your search results. The listicles on page one give way to spiritual advice (page 2), parenting advice (page 3), and pop-psych advice (page 4). On the fifth page of your search results, you find a site that looks like an old-school internet forum, where someone has started a discussion titled Getting more in touch with the seasons?
