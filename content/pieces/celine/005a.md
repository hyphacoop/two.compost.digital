A few days later, you head off on your foraging trip. The ground is no longer an indistinguishable mass of brown and beige. Your gaze feels sharper: you notice the edge of a leaf; a knobbed tree root emerging above the soil; the rare morel and its characteristically wavy, honeycombed cap. You find your first one on the edge of a wooded area, and carry it into the sun to examine it, slicing into it with a paring knife to check if the inside is hollow.

Eventually, you return home with eleven morels. Your neck aches from stooping close to the ground all day, and a fine silt is pressed into your fingernails. But you're incredibly pleased, smug really, and you take a photo for Alice and for the forum strangers that helped you out.

*Easier than expected*, you write on the forum. *Hoping to do this again soon!*
