You'd rather figure it out yourself, you think. A few days before your planned trip, you find yourself furiously searching: best beginner mushroom, easiest mushroom to forage, first mushroom to forage. Whenever you come across the name of a new species you have to open two or three more tabs to figure out if it’s the right season, if it's in your area, if it's easily confused with poisonous mushrooms. Maybe you should make a spreadsheet. Maybe you should post on the forum.

In the end you do neither. You use your lunch break at work to print off a few identification guides for spring mushrooms, and decide that morels seem the most visually distinctive. You feel nervous—nervous of failure, nervous that you'll show up and you won't find anything, But everyone needs a first failure, right?
