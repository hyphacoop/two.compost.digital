The idea of foraging is still a kooky hippie thing to you, but the more you read, the more appealing it becomes. At the very least it has a nice narrative trajectory to it: every post in the What did you find today? discussion begins with uncertainty (the user has never looked for this plant or fungus in the wild; there was too much or too little rain this year), displays the user's increasing mastery, and ends with a high-resolution picture of their haul. The most popular posters tend to arrange their haul in a charming wicker basket or an artfully draped kitchen towel. There is often a moralistic statement like More people should forage, it's so local and sustainable accompanied with complaints about tasteless supermarket berries and Big Ag.
You start thinking, idly and then seriously, about a foraging trip. There is a national park near you that seems promising: a stretch of shore and scenic headlands, where visiters are allowed to gather two gallons plus one mushroom per day. It might be easiest to pick one mushroom to look out for, something easily recognizable and reasonably common. But you're not sure which one to look for.
What if you made an account and asked for advice?
