The idea of foraging is still a kooky hippie thing to you, but the more you read, the more appealing it becomes. At the very least it has a nice narrative trajectory. The What did you find today? thread is full of stories that begin with uncertainty, plunge into disappointment (*I found NOTHING for the first hour!*), and end triumphantly with a high-resolution picture of someone’s haul. Lightly moralistic statements are common — *More people should forage! It's the most sustainable way to eat* — as well as complaints about tasteless supermarket berries and Big Ag.

Eventually you start thinking about a foraging trip. There is a national park near you that seems promising: a stretch of shore next to a forest, laced with hiking trails and gentle slopes. According to the park website, visitors can gather two gallons plus one mushroom per day. On a **Foraging 101** thread, a forum user writes: *If it’s your first time, pick an easy mushroom, something reliable to ID and reasonably common.* But you're not sure which one to look for.

What if you made an account and asked for advice?
