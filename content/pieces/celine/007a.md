“I, um,” you begin. “A friend mentioned them, I guess.”

“It’s nice to have friends into fungi,” he says sincerely, and then moves on into a sales pitch about how incredible they are sautéed or grilled — “like yakitori”, he suggests — while you feel a slow flush of embarrassment.

At home, you turn over the idea of *friendship*. Right now, Alice is very into the word parasocial: a surreal kind of pseudo-friendship where you feel you know a celebrity — when all you really have is their performance of intimacy through social media.

You *do* post on the forum, and you do have some kind of relationship with people there — although it might be a stretch to call it a friendship. One user, **seed_historian**, probably lives in the same time zone as you, which is its own kind of online intimacy. You know what they’ve foraged recently: sea lettuce, bullwhip, kelp, rock weed, and kombu from the coast. But you don’t know them, and they haven’t interacted with you beyond a few polite reactions to your posts. Not really a friend, not really a stranger.

This observation makes you a bit uncomfortable, but you keep on posting. And you consider going on a seaweed foraging trip yourself.
