You decide to make an account. You spend a few minutes deliberating over a username and a suitably anonymous avatar. There’s a field to choose your gender: *Male*, *Female*, *None specified*. You choose the last option and begin writing your first thread:

> **chaparral** I want to try foraging for mushrooms. I know basically nothing…what should I look for?

You’re worried no one will reply, but ten minutes later, you get a notification.

> **myco_mouse** Hello and welcome! I'd look into morels, especially *Morchella rufobrunnea*. They're easy to distinguish and my personal favorite :) A proper morel is hollow inside, whereas a false morel (*Gyromitra esculenta*) isn’t. Good luck!

By the end of the day you receive more replies:

> **ecotope** Also, do not eat them raw. I sauté them in butter for about 10 minutes.

> **bring_a_ruler** Morels were my first mushroom too! Like **myco_mouse** said, pretty easy. FYI: if you're not sure what something is, don’t gather it. Take a photo and ask for an ID later. Don't disturb the environment if you don’t need to.

The responses are encouraging. You imagine your future foraging self — competent and careful, treading lightly on the land and overwhelmed by its largesse.
