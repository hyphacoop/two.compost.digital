You decide to make an account. You spend a few minutes deliberating over a username and a suitably anonymous avatar. There’s a field to choose your gender: *Male*, *Female*, *None specified*. You choose the last option and begin writing your first thread:

> **chaparral** I want to try foraging for mushrooms. I know basically nothing…what should I look for?

You’re worried no one will reply, but ten minutes later, you get a notification.

> **myco_mouse** Hello and welcome! I'd look into morels, especially *Morchella rufobrunnea*. They're easy to distinguish and my personal favorite :) A proper morel will be hollow inside whereas a false morel (*Gyromitra esculenta*) isn’t. Good luck!

By the end of the day:

> **ecotope** Also, do *not* eat them raw. From personal experience…I now sauté them in butter for 5 or 10 minutess.

> **bring_a_ruler** Morels were my first mushroom too! Like mouse said, pretty easy. FYI since you're a newbie: if you're not sure what something is, don't gather it. Take a photo and ask for an ID later, don't disturb the environment if you don’t need to.

The responses are encouraging. You imagine your future foraging self—competent and careful, treading lightly on the land and overwhelmed by its largesse.
